# ToDoList Application

Here's How It Works:

Add Button:
If you wish to add a new item to your ToDoList simply click the "Add" button and a pop-up screen will come up
and ask to enter some specifics such as a title for the item, a breif description as well as an option due date. 
If you choose to enter a due date you'll have a calendar drop down so you are able to select whatever day you may need.
Once done simply click confirm and the table at the main menu will be updated with your new item.

Remove Button:
If you would like to remove an already existing item on the ToDoList simply click on whichever item you want followed by the "Remove" button.
This will refresh the table with the item you chose no longer there.

Edit Button:
If you would like to edit an existing item instead of removing old items and adding them again, you can simply click on the
"Edit" button. This will bring up a pop-up menu that will allow you to rename the item, reschedule the due date and change up the 
description. Once you are done simply click confirm and the table at the main menu will update.

Toggle Completion Button:
You are able to toggle whether an item is done or not simply by clicking on the item and then clicking "Toggle Completion". This will update
the Complete? coloumn of the table to show either false or true, false being no it's not done or true being it is done.

Clear List Button:
If you wish to completely wipe an entire list and start fresh simply click on the "Clear All" button.

Show All Radio Button:
This button will display all the items in the current list you have opened, completed or not.

Show Incomplete Items Radio Button:
This button will only show items that haven't been marked complete.

Show Complete Items Radio Button:
This button will only show items that have been marked complete.

Saving a List:
Once you finish writing down all the  items for your current ToDoList you'll probably want to save it. To do this enter a file name 
for your ToDoList in the text field given and press SAVE. It will create a folder named output and save the list to that folder as a .txt file.

Loading a Previously Made List:
In order to load this list or any you make in the future simply click on the "LOAD List" button. This will bring you to a new screen that will ask you to 
enter the file path of the list. For example if I saved a list from last week and want to open it today I would simply click LOAD List and type in "output/list.txt".
This will refresh the table at the main menu with all the items that were created previously.

Exit Program:
Once you're all done you can simply click "EXIT" and it will close the program. Keep in mind it DOES NOT save any work.
